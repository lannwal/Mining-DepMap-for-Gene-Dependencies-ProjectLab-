\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
    In principle we wrangled DepMap data with Pandas and looked at some of the most interesting co-dependencies.
    We then compare this with a study by the Hart lab, using this data to create essentiality networks.

\section{Introduction}
There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable.
There is another theory which states that this has already happened.


\section{Motivation}

the depmap portal provides xsdfs...
we deciced to look for more detailed information
on the codependencies/coessentialities of interesting
genes in an approach similar to Kim et al (Hart Lab).


``I always thought something was fundamentally wrong with the universe'' \citep{adams1995hitchhiker}
